You are to participate in a research coordinated by Dr. Balázs Aczél from Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), aczel.balazs@ppk.elte.hu. The aim of this study is to investigate researcher burnout, its possible mitigating factors across different career stages and their relationship with researcher decisions and behaviors.



Participation is voluntary. Performing the various tasks and filling out the questionnaires is theoretically harmless, but some might feel unease or anxiety when thinking about their current employment circumstances. For this reason it is possible to suspend participation so that it should not be tiresome. It is also possible to terminate participation at any time and to decline answering questions without having to give reasons for this. Monetary compensation is not due for participation.



Questionnaires have to be filled out which will last for about 10 minutes.



All information collected during this process will be handled strictly confidentially. Data of the research are analyzed statistically during which no personal identification is possible. Written account about the study and the data processing can be provided upon request.



By proceeding you agree that data collected on your person – which cannot be identified as those belonging to your person – may be used for research purposes and that these will be accessible to other researchers.
